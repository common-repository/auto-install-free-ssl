### Benefits of installing an SSL certificate on your WordPress website

1. **Protect your users' data:** If an SSL certificate is installed, your WordPress website's data travels through the internet with 2048-bit (or more) encryption. No computer or hacker in between can read your users' encrypted data. Only the intended recipient (users' browser or your server) can decrypt and read the encrypted data. The data may be credit card-like necessary payment details, user input with a contact form, or a simple login form.

1. **Display PADLOCK:** Installing an SSL certificate is not optional anymore, even if your WordPress website doesn't accept credit cards. Since July 2018, with version 68, Google Chrome has started to mark all HTTP (no SSL) websites as 'Not secure', even if it doesn't accept user input. All other browsers followed the same path. When users visit an SSL-secured website, all browsers display a secured PADLOCK in the address bar.

1. **Boost the Search Engine Ranking:** Google and other search engines aim to create a secure web. So, search engines now favor SSL-secured HTTPS websites and discourage insecure ones in the search results. If your WordPress website doesn't have an SSL certificate installed, you are missing something significant regarding SEO and staying away from potential customers.

1. **Gain the trust of your users:** If users see the secured PADLOCK and HTTPS connection in the URL, they are assured that your website is secured. Now you are gaining the trust of your potential customers. They are confident to purchase your product or service.

We appreciate your help improving the plugin by letting us track a few non-sensitive usage data.
 

**How to generate a Free SSL Certificate**

Generating a free encryption certificate is straightforward. Please follow the steps below:

1. After the previous step, you'll be redirected to the Generate SSL page (in most cases). Otherwise, navigate to the 'Auto-Install Free SSL' menu in the sidebar, and click the 'Generate SSL' option. [Screenshot here.](https://ps.w.org/auto-install-free-ssl/assets/screenshot-1.png?rev=2750244)
1. On the next page, i.e., the 'Generate Free SSL Certificate' page, read & agree to the Let's Encrypt™ Subscriber Agreement and FreeSSL.tech Terms of Service & Privacy Policy by clicking the relevant checkboxes. Then click the 'Next Step' button and 'OK' in the confirmation dialog box. [Screenshot here.](https://ps.w.org/auto-install-free-ssl/assets/screenshot-2.png?rev=2750244)
1. Wait a few seconds. Then you see the second step: 'Verify Domain'. Please check the [screenshot](https://ps.w.org/auto-install-free-ssl/assets/screenshot-3.png?rev=2750244). You have two methods, HTTP-01 and DNS-01, to verify your domain ownership. You need to complete any one method. We are discussing only the HTTP-01 method, the most popular, easiest, and time-saving method.

### HTTP-01
Please follow these steps:

* Log in to your web server with an FTP client (e.g., FileZilla) or the file manager of your web hosting control panel.
* Browse to the document root of your WordPress website. It will be like: `/home/username/public_html/wp-site` . Create a directory, **'.well-known'** and another directory, **'acme-challenge'**, inside the **'.well-known'** directory.
* Click the links' Challenge File 1' and 'Challenge File 2' to download the HTTP-01 challenge files. Please remember that if the ***www.*** alias of your WordPress website doesn't point to your web server (i.e., offline), you get only one challenge file.
* Upload the downloaded challenge files to the **'acme-challenge'** directory.
* Uploaded files should be available at 'Link 1' and 'Link 2'. Please click the links. The content/text of the links should EXACTLY match the content of the downloaded files. If it matches correctly, click the 'Verify Domain (HTTP-01) & Generate Free SSL' button, and in the confirmation dialog box, click 'OK'.

Now wait a few seconds, and you will see a free SSL certificate has been issued to your WordPress website. The page looks like this [screenshot](https://ps.w.org/auto-install-free-ssl/assets/screenshot-4.png?rev=2750244). Download the SSL, Private Key, and CA Bundle files (**.pem**) by clicking the links.

After this, log in to your web hosting control panel and install the SSL certificate on your WordPress website.

 

**How to install the SSL certificate with cPanel**

1. Log in to your cPanel.
1. Type 'SSL' in the 'Search Tools' text box (in the upper-right corner).
1. You get a few search results instantly. Click on the 'SSL/TLS'. (Don't click the 'SSL/TLS Status'.)
1. On the SSL/TLS page, you get an option 'INSTALL AND MANAGE SSL FOR YOUR SITE (HTTPS)' at the bottom with a link 'Manage SSL sites.' Click it.
1. On the next page, i.e., 'Manage SSL Hosts', you get a section at the bottom, 'Install an SSL Website'. Here you get a form to install the SSL certificate.
1. From the 'Select a Domain' drop-down menu, select the domain of your WordPress website.
1. Open the **'certificate.pem'** file (you downloaded it) in a text editor and copy all its content/text, including '—–BEGIN CERTIFICATE—–' and '—–END CERTIFICATE—–'. Paste it in the 'Certificate: (CRT)' text area.
1. Similarly, paste all the content of the **'private.pem'** file in the 'Private Key (KEY)' text area.
1. Then paste all the content of the **'cabundle.pem'** file in the 'Certificate Authority Bundle: (CABUNDLE)' text area.
1. Now click the 'Install Certificate' button and wait a few seconds. Then you get the confirmation dialog box 'SSL Host Successfully Installed.' Click 'OK'.

 

**How to install the SSL certificate with Plesk**

1. Log in to your Plesk control panel.
1. Click the 'Websites & Domains' option in the left menu.
1. Click on the website for which you need an SSL certificate. There are several options under it.
1. Click the option 'SSL/TLS Certificates'.
1. Click the 'Manage' button on the next page in the 'Download or remove existing certificates' option.
1. Click the 'Add SSL/TLS Certificate' button on the next page.
1. You got the 'Add SSL/TLS Certificate' page.
1. In the 'Certificate Name' text field, write a name.
1. You got a section at the bottom of the page, 'Upload the certificate as text'. Here you have a form to install the SSL certificate.
1. Open the **'certificate.pem'** file (you downloaded it) in a text editor and copy all its content, including '—–BEGIN CERTIFICATE—–' and '—–END CERTIFICATE—–'. Paste it in the 'Certificate' text area of Plesk.
1. Similarly, paste all the content of the **'private.pem'** file in the 'Private key' text area of Plesk.
1. Then paste all the content of the **'cabundle.pem'** file in the 'CA certificate' text area of Plesk.
1. Now click the 'Upload Certificate' button.
1. The uploaded SSL certificate is listed on the next page.
1. Again, click 'Websites & Domains' in the left menu.
1. Click the website for which you need an SSL certificate.
1. Click the 'Hosting & DNS' tab and the 'Hosting Settings' option.
1. On the next page, i.e., the 'Hosting Settings' page, click the 'Certificate' selection field and select the certificate we just uploaded.
1. Click the 'Apply' button and then click 'OK'.
1. Congratulations! The SSL certificate has been installed successfully.


Now you can access your website with **‘https://’**.

The options will differ if your web hosting control panel is anything other than cPanel and Plesk, but the concept is similar.

**NOTE:** The free SSL security certificate issued by Let's Encrypt™ expires in 90 days. So you need to spend time repeating the process of generating and installing an SSL certificate every 60 days. They recommend renewing 30 days before expiry.

Click the 'Re-generate (renew) SSL' button to start renewing.

However, **the premium version of this plugin generates (issue/renew) and installs the free SSL certificate automatically.** Please check the video tutorial (1:42 min) below and see how easy it is.

**How to Activate Force HTTPS / HTTPS Redirect**

After installing the SSL certificate, please perform the following steps:

1. In your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the 'Auto-Install Free SSL' menu in the sidebar, and click the 'Force HTTPS' menu.
1. On the next page, click the 'Activate Force HTTPS' button. Then click OK.
1. You'll be logged out and redirected to the WordPress login page. Please log in again.
1. Now refresh the website's home page. You'll see the padlock.

 

**Troubleshooting**

Access the 'Log' menu within the ‘Auto-Install Free SSL’ menu in the left-hand sidebar. Be sure to review the log for any insights.

If you encounter issues with the Let's Encrypt™ API connection and wish to log Let's Encrypt™ server response details for each API call, you can achieve this by writing the following URL in the address bar by replacing 'www.example.com' with your domain name, and hit enter:

 ` http://www.example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=auto_install_free_ssl&log_all_ca_server_response=yes `

To stop logging all responses from the Let's Encrypt™ server, replace ‘yes’ with ‘no’ in the above URL.

Please [click here](https://freessl.tech/wordpress-letsencrypt-free-ssl-certificate-documentation/?utm_source=wp_org&utm_medium=faq&utm_campaign=aifs_free&utm_content=faq_1#plugin-installation) to learn about plugin installation.

= Does installing the free SSL plugin will instantly turn my site into HTTPS? =

Sorry, it doesn't. Installing the plugin and installing SSL certificates are two different processes. After installing this plugin, you need to do some steps. Please check the 'AFTER ACTIVATION' section in the [documentation](https://freessl.tech/wordpress-letsencrypt-free-ssl-certificate-documentation/?utm_source=wp_org&utm_medium=faq&utm_campaign=aifs_free&utm_content=faq_2#after-activation).

However, the Premium plugin installs SSL certificates with complete automation. Please check the video tutorial (1:42 min) at the top of this page and see how easy it is.

= My website doesn't accept credit cards. Why do I need an SSL certificate? =

Please check the 'Benefits of installing an SSL certificate on your WordPress website' above.

= How do I generate a free SSL certificate? =

Please check the [documentation](https://freessl.tech/wordpress-letsencrypt-free-ssl-certificate-documentation/?utm_source=wp_org&utm_medium=faq&utm_campaign=aifs_free&utm_content=faq_4#generate-free-ssl). This documentation is for the free version of the plugin.

If you want complete automation, please check the Premium version's video tutorial (1:42 min) at the top of this page.

= How do I install an SSL certificate on my WordPress website? =

Please [click here](https://freessl.tech/wordpress-letsencrypt-free-ssl-certificate-documentation/?utm_source=wp_org&utm_medium=faq&utm_campaign=aifs_free&utm_content=faq_5#install-free-ssl) to learn about installing an SSL certificate on your WordPress website.

FYI, the Premium version installs SSL certificates with complete automation.

= I see a blank page when I try to generate an SSL certificate. How can I fix it? =

Please check the log. It is located in the plugin menu. Most probably, you see an error saying 'unable to register the account' along with the following text in the log:
` urn:ietf:params:acme:error:invalidEmail `

Let's Encrypt™ API throws this error if an invalid email was set as the admin email of your WordPress website, for example, "yourname@yourdomain.mamp" or "anything@example.com". Let's Encrypt™ expects we should register an account with a working email.

To fix this, please update this plugin to the latest version and try generating the SSL again. Then you'll get a text field to update the admin email address.

Feel free to contact us through the WordPress support forum if you still need help with any issues (with the complete log).

= I have installed an SSL certificate but still don't see any PADLOCK in the browser's address bar. Why? =

Please visit the plugin's 'Force HTTPS' page and click the 'Activate Force HTTPS' button.

= After installing an SSL certificate, I clicked the 'Activate Force HTTPS' button. But I got this error: "No valid SSL is installed". How can I fix it? =

This is a temporary issue. You may wait 24 hours or follow these steps:

Please access your website with HTTPS (e.g., https://example.com). If you are sure that the SSL certificate is installed correctly and the padlock is visible, please log in to your WordPress dashboard, open a new tab, write the following URL in the address bar by replacing 'www.example.com' with your domain name, and hit enter:

 ` http://www.example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=aifs_force_https&aifsaction=aifs_force_https_override&checked_ssl_manually=done&valid_ssl_installed=yes `

= How do I deactivate the HTTPS redirect? =

Please click the 'Revert to HTTP' button on the plugin's 'Force HTTPS' page.

Alternatively, open the email you received after activating the HTTPS redirect (or Force HTTPS) and click the link to deactivate HTTPS redirect and revert to HTTP. The subject line of that email is "'Auto-Install Free SSL' has activated Force HTTPS on your website YourDomain.com". [Replace YourDomain.com with your WordPress website's domain].

= Are my website's WWW and non-WWW versions included in the free SSL certificate? =

If your website is accessible with WWW and non-WWW versions of the domain name (e.g., www.example.com and example.com) and both A record points to the same IP address, our plugin will include both versions in the free SSL certificate.

= Why is the validity of the free SSL certificate 90 days? Is it a trial? =

The validity period of free HTTPS certificate being 90 days is not a trial but rather a design choice of Let's Encrypt™ that prioritizes security. With shorter validity periods, Let's Encrypt™ encourages frequent certificate renewal, ensuring that websites always have up-to-date and secure certificates. This approach reduces the potential impact of compromised certificates.

The [premium version](https://freessl.tech/free-ssl-certificate-for-wordpress-website/?utm_source=wp_org&utm_medium=faq&utm_campaign=aifs_free&utm_content=faq_11) of this plugin renews SSL certificates automatically. Automated renewal processes also make it easier for website owners to maintain security without manual intervention. While the 90-day validity might seem short, the automated renewal process ensures seamless and continuous protection for your website's users.

Please [click here](https://letsencrypt.org/2015/11/09/why-90-days.html) to learn the statement of Let's Encrypt™.

= Does this plugin generate free SSL certificates for bare IP addresses (e.g., https://204.12.132.37)? =

Let's Encrypt™ issues SSL certificates for domain names rather than bare IP addresses. Free TLS certificates are designed to secure domain names, providing encrypted connections between users and websites. Using SSL certificates with domain names is considered the industry's best practice.

If you're looking to secure a website, it's recommended to associate a domain name with the IP address rather than using the bare IP address. This enhances the user experience and aligns with security and usability standards.

= [Pro] Why do you need my cPanel password (or API Token) when other Let's Encrypt clients don't? =

All other Let's Encrypt clients who auto-install free SSL certificates need root access, a higher privilege than the cPanel user. In shared hosting, the root access belongs to the web hosting company. So those clients will not work on shared hosting.

cPanel username and password (or API Token) are required to install the free SSL certificate with the cPanel API automatically. Let's Encrypt SSL's lifetime is 90 days. You need to get and install another SSL certificate before the expiration of the current SSL. If you provide your cPanel username and password (or API Token), this plugin will do this repeated job automatically. All your credentials remain safe in your database. Moreover, 'Auto-Install Free SSL'  encrypts the password (or API Token) before saving it in your database.

= [Pro] Does this WordPress plugin send the cPanel username and cPanel password (or API Token) to your server or to Let's Encrypt? =

We or Let's Encrypt don't collect any credentials. **This plugin's source code is open for audit.** The WordPress team approved it after the audit. Please feel free to audit yourself too.

= [Pro] How do I create the cron job for automation? =

You don't need to set the Cron Job manually. It works by default (from version 3.0.0). However, 'Auto-Install Free SSL' can add an optional cron job with one click from your WordPress dashboard (available for unlimited sites license).

= [Pro] I received the confirmation email but didn't receive the cron output by email. Why? =

Since version 3.0.0, You can access the cron output by clicking the 'Log' menu.

If you have an unlimited site license and created a cron job manually, ensure you have provided your email address in the 'Cron Email' section of the Cron Jobs page of cPanel.

However, this caused issues for some websites to generate free ssl cert, especially those using CDNs. In this update, we've adjusted our approach: by default, only the 'mail.' alias A record is verified, as was the case in version 3.6.2 and earlier. However, the user can enable A record verification for all domain aliases if needed by setting 'aifs_verify_ip_for_all_domain_alias' to true.

= 3.6.4 =
* Improved the detection process (and fixed a related bug) of the server's IPv4 address where the WordPress website is hosted.
* Updated the Freemius WordPress SDK to version 2.5.12.

= 3.6.3 =
* Resolved a loading issue with the theme editor in the WordPress 6.3 dashboard when Force HTTPS is activated.
* Enhanced IP address verification logic for all available domain aliases, as opposed to solely the 'mail.' alias in previous versions. Now, it filters out the domain alias (when generating the free TLS certificate) if its A record differs from the server's IP address. Note that if the option 'aifs_verify_ip_for_mail_dot_domain_alias_only' is set to true, it will verify the IP address of the 'mail.' alias exclusively. However, if the option 'aifs_selected_verification_method_dns01' is set to true (making DNS-01 the default method), the above verification will not occur.
* Updated the Freemius WordPress SDK to version 2.5.11.

= 3.6.2 =
* Enhanced error handling logic for cases where after submitting a request to the 'finalize' URL, the response from Let's Encrypt contains an empty 'certificate' key (location value).
* Resolved an issue where the 'finalize' response in the cert free generation process was unintentionally removed from the database.
* Introduced a new capability to activate the option 'aifs_log_all_ca_server_response' by accessing the following URL (login required):
http://www.example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=auto_install_free_ssl&log_all_ca_server_response=yes    (Please replace 'www.example.com' with your domain name.)

= 3.6.1 =
* Fixed the issue with character encoding for sending automated email notifications to support multilingual characters.
* Added feature to write Let's Encrypt free https cert server response details in the log files for every API call (if the option 'aifs_log_all_ca_server_response' is set to true). This will be helpful for troubleshooting.
* Removed WordPress translation function __() for some error and exception messages (which are intended for developers) to make those English only.
* Tested up to: 6.3

= 3.6.0 =
* Improved the domainsArray() function that filters domain and server alias.
* Created a new function to detect the IPv4 of the server.
* Created a new function to get the confirmed and domain-specific free https ssl certificate directory.
* Improved the function that detects the cPanel host and fixed a premium version-specific issue with it.
* Updated the Freemius WordPress SDK to 2.5.10
* Automatic entry of some initial data has been moved to the activation hook.
* [Pro] Improved the function sslRequiredForFirstTime() called before generating a free web ssl certificate.
* [Pro] Created a new function to detect if the given domains array has at least one Wildcard domain.
* [Pro] Improved some free tls cert generation and installation logic.
* [Pro] Added a feature that detects if the cPanel hostname was changed and updates it automatically.
* [Pro] Added a feature that detects if cPanel credentials were changed and send notifications by email and admin notice.
* [Pro] Improved the functionality to send notifications by email and admin notice if the encryption key was changed.
